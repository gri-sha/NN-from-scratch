# NN-from-scratch
A simple MNIST classifier built from scratch using NumPy. Achieves 96% accuracy.

## How to Run
1. **Download the data**:  
   Run `download_mnist.py` to fetch the MNIST dataset.  
2. **Train & Test**:  
   Open and run `mnist_classifier.ipynb` to train the model and evaluate accuracy.

## Features
- Built entirely with NumPyâ€”no deep learning libraries used (TensorFlow is only needed for data download).   
- Uses `matplotlib` for visualizing results.
